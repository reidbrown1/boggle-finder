    <p className="text-gray-600">
      I created a program that would solve Wordle puzzles with 100% accuracy. After making $500 from playing cash games, they banned my account.

      I then moved on to Words Race, where I developed a system that could find every possible word in a grid. I made over $2,000 before they caught on and banned me again.

      When you first start playing, you'll be matched with opponents quickly. As your win rate and scores increase, the matching process may take longer - sometimes a few hours - as the system looks for suitable opponents at your skill level. Don't worry though, your matches will still be completed, just with a bit more patience.
